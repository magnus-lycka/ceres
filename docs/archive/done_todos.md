# Completed todo items

Moved from `docs/todo_maybe.md` once fully implemented.

## Naming

Renamed `self.owner` → `self.ship` and `_owner` → `_ship` throughout `parts.py` and all subclasses.

## Software Singleton

Note that Software Packages are Singletons

If user e.g. lists JumpContrl/2 and then JumpControl/3,
they have (and pay for) JumpControl/3, and a warning that
redundant JumpControl/2 was added. Note the included
JumpControl SW in Core models. I assume that if your main
is a Core, and your spare is a (non Core) computer, it
can still run the Core supplied SW within the capacity of
its rating.

## Quantities

If we have 10 staterooms, it should say Staterooms ✕ 10.
The same is probably true for many other items. If it's
just one, it can just say Stateroom.

Current status:

- done for Staterooms
- done for Low Berths
- done for Probe Drones
- done for grouped spec rows such as Airlocks
- done for crew table rows

## Decentralize build_spec

Move substantial parts of Ship.build_spec() out to the
sections that own the rows, such as storage, computer,
habitation and systems.

Current status:

- done for hull
- done for drives / power
- done for storage (fuel + cargo)
- done for command
- done for computer
- done for sensors
- done for habitation
- done for systems
- done for weapons
- done for craft

Note:

- expense / crew summary now live in `expense.py` and `crew.py`
- a couple of generic row-grouping helpers still remain in `Ship`, but the section-level decentralization itself is complete

## Implement armoured bulkhead

Armoured bulkheads protect specific areas and
systems, such as the jump drive or fuel tanks, making
them much more resilient to damage.
Adding armoured bulkheads consumes an amount of
space equal to 10% of the tonnage of the protected
item. During space combat, the Severity of any critical
hit to the protected space is reduced by -1 (to a
minimum of Severity 1).

Option Cost
Armoured Bulkhead MCr0.2 per ton

Current status:

- `ArmouredBulkhead` implemented in `hull.py`
- cost and tonnage modeled
- protection target shown in spec notes
- treated as a ship-design/spec concern, not as combat simulation logic

## Limit TL

Make a note in ARCHITECTURE.md that support is limited to TL16 and lower, and
stick to that when writing code. For now we cap ship TL to 16 and don't bother
to implement TL17+ features.

Current status:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` now states the TL16 cap explicitly
- `Ship` now rejects `tl > 16`
- TL17+ features are intentionally out of scope for now

## Expense module

Break out expense code to its own module expense.py

## Combine propulsion and jump sections

Maybe it's better to combine jump and propulsion to a drives section?

## x vs ×

Counted labels now go through shared helpers in `ceres.make.ship.text`, so the display form is consistently `×`
instead of `x`, and repeated labels are collapsed in one place instead of being reimplemented separately.
